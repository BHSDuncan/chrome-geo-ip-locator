# Chrome Geo IP Locator Extension

Simple Chrome extension that allows you to view the geographic information of any valid, highlighted IPv4 or IPv6 address in your Chrome browser. Simply highlight the IP, right click, and have the extension do the lookup. Easy as pi(e).

The extension calls out to ip-api.com (http://ip-api.com/docs/).  Note there is currently a rate limit of 150 requests/minute and is meant for non-commercial use only (though apparently if you contact the API creator they can discuss cutting a deal for commercial use).

*Possible Changes*
- Look at decoupling the specific geolocation API.
- Look at making the output a bit nicer. It currently is presented in an alert box.

*Bugs*
